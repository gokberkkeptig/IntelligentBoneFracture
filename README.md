# Intelligent-Bone-Fractures-Detection-and-Classification-System
Technological developments are getting more critical in medical fields.  Over many years,in  the  medical  field,  we  use  these  technology  such  as  X-rays,  digital  radiography,  andultrasound to detect diagnosis and make decision purposes.  Radiologist and the doctorsthat are related to this field can make many accurate and precise decisions using thesetechnological improvements.  Since the determination of fractures also affects the treat-ment process, we wanted to develop a program to facilitate both doctorsâ€™ work and avoidpossible  scenarios  in  which  the  human  eye  may  have  difficulty  distinguishing.   We  willtry to determine the fracture of the humerus bone X-rays we received from the user inour  work.   The  first  step  is  detecting  bone  segments  accurately.   We  will  use  differenttechniques to achieve our aims and objectives, which we discuss in later sections.
